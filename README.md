# ml-project-1-jlg_project1_ml

The goal of this project is to use regression tasks to predict if the decay signature of a collision event is a Higgs boson (signal) or something else (background) based on some features representing the decay signature. Only numpy and matplotlib libraries are allowed.

Our repository is composed :
- Scripts folder : It contains the code which is organized in one jupyter notebook which contains the best results for each regression function and different scripts of functions. implementations.py contains the regression functions, preprocessing.py contains all functions to preprocess the original matrix, cross_validation.py has different cross-validated and best parameter selection methods, proj1_helpers.py and helpers2.py contain different helper functions, run.py contain the code for the submission of our best result.
- Data folder : It contains the training data that we used to find relevant models, the test data that we used to do our AIcrowd submissions after selecting the best predicted models on the training data. It contains also our best submission that can be reproduced by using run.py script. Be aware that you have to unzip the training and the test data before using it.
- The report : It is a pdf file that summarize our results and our decision process.
- The readme

Our results can be reproduced by using Python 3.8
